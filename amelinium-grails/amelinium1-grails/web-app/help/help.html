	<h1>This is release - you can add number of story points like this
		"- 0/10sp" or leave it for recalculator to do</h1>
	<p>This is feature - it mostly does the same job as release but it
		wraps smaller parts in groups - groups of stories.</p>
	<p>Feature sums the number of story points the group of stories
		reperesent like this:</p>
	<p>My simple feature - ?/?sp</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Story 1 - 10sp - i think its very hard story and thats why i
			give it 10 story points.</li>
		<li>Story about how to specify points - 5 sp - To specify points
			just add such pattern to story " - Xsp" where X is the number of
			story points. If you wont specify story points, the recalculator assumes its 0sp</li>
		<li>You can also add comments to stories or even tables - 1sp</li>
		<ul>
			<li>To do it just increase indent of story - now this is a
				comment added to story "You can also add ... - 1sp", its very simple</li>
			<li>You can also add tables as comments like this:</li>
			<li>
				<table style="height: 50px;" width="328">
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>This table</td>
							<td>has some text</td>
							<td>in it</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>and it</td>
							<td>counts as</td>
							<td>comment :)</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h1>If you mess up some editing use "Undo/Redo" buttons</h1>
	<p>To check if everything is ok after editing you can use</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Source code - to see HTML based document, its very good to
			edit critical errors</li>
		<li>Check preview - it will show you how the document will be
			looking after save or update</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Buttons used for persistence are the save and update buttons</h1>
	<ul>

			backlog view</li>
	</ul>
